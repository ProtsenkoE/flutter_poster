## Installation

If you're new to Flutter the first thing you'll need is to follow the [setup instructions](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

Once Flutter is setup, you can use the default `stable` channel, or switch to the latest `dev` version to get the most current fixes for desktop/web:
* Run `flutter channel dev`
* Run `flutter upgrade`

If you've never run a desktop build before, you will need to enable it with a one-time command for your current platform:
* `flutter config --enable-macos-desktop`
* `flutter config --enable-windows-desktop`
* `flutter config --enable-linux-desktop`

Once you're on `dev` and desktop is enabled, you're ready to run the app:
* `flutter run -d windows`
* `flutter run -d macos`
* `flutter run -d linux`
* `flutter run -d android`
* `flutter run -d ios`
* `flutter run -d web`
